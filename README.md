# Cultural Compass

Cultural Compass is a web application that helps travelers understand cultural differences between cities. Using the power of ChatGPT, it provides dynamic, accurate information about cultural norms, tipping customs, greetings, and unique local foods to help users navigate new cultural environments.

## How It Works

Cultural Compass uses the ChatGPT API to generate accurate, up-to-date cultural information for any city in the world. When you enter two cities to compare, the application:

1. Makes API calls to ChatGPT to get cultural information for both cities
2. Caches the results to minimize API calls
3. Presents the information in an easy-to-read comparison format
